# Weather API challenge

> Write a Node JS script that will fetch the weather for a city specified by the user and output the average minimum and maximum temperatures for the next five days to the console


## The challenge

The script has been started, but the bulk of the code is missing. Fill in the gaps to make the script work.

Rules:

- Don't delete or alter any of the code that's there already
- The temperatures should be displayed to 2 decimal places
- Don't worry about any error handling other than what's in place already


## Set up

```
npm install
```


## Running the script

```sh
node getWeather --city <CITY NAME>
```

Example

```sh
node getWeather --city Barcelona
The average five day forecast temperatures for Barcelona are
  Minimum: 15.06 degrees C
  Maximum: 21.47 degreees C
```
